Which map to use for the project:
i can just create random blocks, set them, change color and so on. this i can control through imgui; 

usage of imgui:
i will have 2 windows in imgui. first for the blocks, second for the circle(the source of light);
what i will include: 
for blocks:
-changing color. changing dimensions all blocks. changing dimension an exact block, delete exact block 
for the light:
-changing color. changing dimension. changing dimension of the light, like how far the light will be lighting. changing speed

control: 
mouse - setting blocks. Imgui will resolve problem with appending/deleting
keyboard - imgui, controlling the block

Goals: 
- make smooth control / moving
- make 2d light with shadows
- pin up usage of ImGui
- learn SDL3


First of all try to build this in one file. cuz this project isn't that big for creating multiple files in fact.


Steps for getting all of this:
Blocks
- Make system of appending block via the mouse - done
- Try to insert ImGui into this system - done
- Implement in ImGui: 
  - setting a current block to work, if empty - will affect on all blocks - done
  - appending blocks (Click and at the cursor we can set our block) - done on the right button of the mouse
  - delete blocks (we can just write down the number and accept. if it more, than size of the vector -    		   delete the last appended) - done 
  - changing colors - done
  - changing dimension (w, y) - done via the wheel
  - clear all blocks at once - done
Circle
- Create a circle, which will be a source of light - done
- Create smooth moving for this circle - done
- create a light of the circle 
- create imgui for this circle 
- Implement in imgui:
  - Color of the light
  - dimension of the light 
  - speed of moving of the circle 

Addition idea:
- make a narrow source of light, i mean i can only look at an exact side and there will be ligting 


Final step:
- use math for creating rays in order to correlate this with the circle and the blocks
